# Ayurveda & Siddha Chatbot

This is a web-based chatbot application designed to provide natural health support using the ancient practices of **Ayurveda**, **Siddha medicine**, **home remedies**, and **Tamil traditional wellness**. The system strictly avoids recommendations related to hospitals or modern allopathic medicine, focusing only on holistic healing.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In rural and semi-urban areas, people often lack access to reliable and structured platforms for traditional health knowledge. Our goal is to make this wisdom accessible, understandable, and available on-demand through a conversational chatbot interface.
